        "3. An IDE can include features like syntax highlighting, code completion, version control, and debugging.\n",

What is Anaconda? \"Anaconda is a open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing (data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc.), that aims to simplify package management and deployment. The distribution includes data-science packages suitable for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "31. Now, files don't have to be in your current working directory for you to access them in Python. But you'll need to provide the full file path (i.e. location information or directory information for where that file is located on your computer).\n",
        "\n",
        "32. Go ahead and create an `EoC_II` folder and set that folder as your working directory in Spyder. It might also be a good idea to start creating lab-specific sub-folders within your `EoC_II` parent folder. \n",

        "# Debugging\n",
        "\n",
        "42. To paraphrase an old programming joke, writing code is 90% of the work of programming. Debugging is the other 90%.\n",
        "\n",
        "43. You've been working on a program for hours, your head hurts, and something still isn't working. We all know a version of that feeling.\n",
        "\n",
        "44. There's no easy solution that will prevent all problems (or \"bugs\") in your code. But having strategies for testing your code, recognizing and making sense of error messages, and methodically debugging your code can help immensely.\n",
        "\n",
        "45. Python errors will usually fall into three types: syntax, runtime, and semantic.\n",
        "\n",
        "46. Syntax refers to the structure of a program and rules about that structure. \n",
        "\n",
        "47. ***Syntax errors*** involve things like indentation, parenthesis, etc. The Python interpreter expects the language to be structured a specific way, and throws a syntax error when it's not.\n",
        "\n",
        "48. ***Runtime errors***, or ***exceptions***: appears after a program has started running. These errors indicate something unexpected has happened that interrupts or stops the program execution. \n",
        "\n",
        "49. Things that can cause a runtime error include:\n",
        "- Misspelled or incorrectly capitalized variables or function names\n",
        "- Dividing by zero\n",
        "- Mismatched data types (i.e. attempting to perform operations on data of the wrong type)\n",
        "- Attempting to use a type conversion function on a value that can't be converted\n",
        "\n",
        "50. Semantic: relates to meaning. \n",
        "\n",
        "51. ***Semantic errors*** have to do with the meaning (or purpose/intent) of your code. Semantic errors don't show up as error messages-but the program will not do what you expect it to do. \n",
        "\n",
        "52. The debugging strategies discussed here will focus on semantic errors but are useful for all types of errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Stepwise debugging in Spyder\n",
        "\n",
        "53. Spyder will catch many syntax and runtime errors. \n",
        "\n",
        "54. Hover over a red `X` by any of your lines of code to see more information about a possible error.\n",
        "\n",
        "55. Spyder integrates the enhanced `ipdb` debugger, which gives you robust options for troubleshooting or debugging your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "56. Specifically, the debugger will let you run a program line by line, running a single line of code and waiting for you to tell it to continue.\n",
        "\n",
        "57. Running your program through this kind of debugging is immensely valuable for tracking down bugs or catching complex issues in a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "58. This mode of debugging includes the following possible steps or \"moves\":\n",
        "- Continue (run the program until the next breakpoint)\n",
        "- Step in (executes the next line of code; if the next line of code is a function, the debugger will 'step into' the first line of that function)\n",
        "- Step over (executes the next line of code, but will not go line-by-line through the function; the debugger 'steps over' the function code and waits for the function call to return)\n",
        "- Step out (lets you step out of a function if you used step in and want to 'step out' of the function)\n",
        "- Stop (stops debugging and terminates the program)\n",
